### Chatbots
Project Description

 The Chatbot I created is named Victor, a bot made for brief conversations on Facebook for people that want to kill some time. He's basic, and I might develop him further (it's unlikely). I hope for people to be able to have a little bit of fun with the bot, and find something to do if they're not busy. All in all, I understand the purpose of the resources provided to me was to get a good idea of what AI and Bots are like, and that I certainly have done.
